# kospex

Kospex is a CLI which aims to _"look at the guts of your code"_ to help gain insights into your developers and technology landscape.
It uses database structure from the excellent [Mergestat lite](https://github.com/mergestat/mergestat-lite) to model data from git repositories. 

## Key Use Cases and features

 - Identify technology landscape
 - Identify active developers (e.g. who's had their code committer in the last 90 days)
 - Identify key person or offboarding risk
 - Identify potential complexity challenges (or conceptual integrity concerns)
 - Aggregate repo metadata into a single database for easier and faster querying

## What is a kospex?

We're aiming to [k]now your c[o]de by in[spe]cting the haruspe[x].
From Wikipedia, _The Latin terms haruspex and haruspicina are from an archaic word, hÄ«ra = "entrails, intestines"_

So we're going to help look at the "guts of your code" to gain an understanding of the applications, technology landscape (sprawl?) and developers.
