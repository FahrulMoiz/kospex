# Metrics

## Introduction

Here are some commons questions people are about their code and repositories:
- "what does good look like?"
- "is my code base healthy?"
- "is it secure?"
- "is it maintained?"

Here's are some indicators that are easily measurable:
- Date of last commit
- Age of dependency files (e.g. how long since they've been updated)
- Commits in the last 90 days (what we call 'Active' for a repo)
- Number of branches (which may still be app and team dependent)

When looking at dependency file, we can also provide more granular indications.
For example, for each depepdency we can also identify:
- When was the last update (e.g. is is recent?)
- how many versions behind are we? (are we aiming at being n-2)
- Are there known vulnerabilities in this library?

## Predictive maintainence

Trying to identify where we should apply predictive maintenance needs to take into consideration indicators and the organisation, app or team context.

## Our code versus opensource

While we may known if our repo is feature complete, still in active development, scheduled for decommission we won't really know decisions an opensource project has made.
